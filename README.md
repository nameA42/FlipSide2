# FlipSide2

## Scene

This is a rough rendition of two small characters sitting on a coin in a city park. The two characters, 4 tree types, bench,
and 8 buildings are all 3d objects, while the coin and ground are both terrain. The scene is based off of the phrase "catch 
you on the flipside", which I took litterally. The focus of the scene is the "thief" character, the main character, and the
"cop" character, the antagonist. I hope to eventually expand the scene to include more of a slycooper feel in both the main
character and enemy.
